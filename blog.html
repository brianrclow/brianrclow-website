        <p class="blog-p">
            Today's digital landscape is evolving and growing day by day. Software applications no longer have to be developed from scratch. Developers can use frameworks and libraries to build applications for desktop, mobile and web, often at the same time using a single codebase. Frameworks have allowed this process to become mainstream within the development community. In this blog I will explore what frameworks are and, more importantly, how they are aiding developers make better software.

            So what are frameworks?
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Frameworks are platforms for developing software. They take complex functionality and abstract that functionality, making it easier for the developers to create. This allows developers the ability to take generic framework functionality and specify it for their application needs. There are thousands of frameworks for just about every mainstream language used. Frameworks are constantly changing, with the addition of more functionality, it will become easier for developers to use and create.

            What are some popular frontend frameworks?
        </h2>
        <img class="center-images" src="assets/blog/react-vue-angular.jpg"/>
        <p class="blog-p">
            React, released in 2013, owned by Facebook and is the most popular frontend JavaScript framework. Since it is one of the older modern frameworks there are many libraries available to use with React to extend its functionality.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-p">
            Vue, released in 2014, is owned by Even You and has recently been proven to have very few security vulnerabilities according to the JavaScript Frameworks Security Report 2019 (prove the validity of study). One major difference between Vue and other frameworks are that Vue makes clear that its component html, typescript and style sheets are all bundled into one single file, which many people find to be helpful when developing. Vue is also known to be less complicated when compared to React or Angular, based on their overall structure. 
        </p>

        <p class="blog-p">
            Angular, released in 2016, is owned by Google and has been growing significantly in popularity since its debut. Some of Angular’s more well-known features are two-way data binding , html directives, dependency injection and the Angular CLI.

            What are some advantages and disadvantages to using frontend frameworks?
        </h2>
        <h3 class="blog-h3">
            Advantages
        </h3>
        <img class="center-images thumbs" src="assets/blog/thumbs_up.png"/>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Efficiency
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Each framework handles functionality differently, but many have features that can create a boilerplate application that developers can use for rapid prototyping. It is much more efficient to use the prebuilt functions then build everything from scratch. Some frameworks can even use a single codebase to produce a desktop app, mobile app and website.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Security
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Frameworks often have security functionality implemented already, in addition to external libraries, that can be used for security of different functionality. The more developers that use a framework, the more the framework is tested, which allow developers to aid in keeping the framework secure.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Cost
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Many frameworks are free to use which encourages developers to use them. This helps bring the overall cost of software down for the company and the consumer. Cost is a major prohibitor to many people within the tech world, and with most frameworks free to use, it allows for all people to use them.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Support
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Since several of the most popular frameworks are being backed by large companies, such as Facebook and Google, their support will contribute to a strong presence for many years to come. This also highlights that there is a plethora of support in the form of documentation, tutorials and online classes. That is again very beneficial because anyone can get help to learn how to use a framework.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-h3">
            Disadvantages
        </h3>
        <img class="center-images thumbs" src="assets/blog/thumbs_down.png"/>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            A framework is not a language
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            A common misconception with frameworks are that after you learn a framework you know languages, styling and formatting, such as html, css and javascript. If you learn javascript through the lens of a framework, you don’t actually know javascript in full, you only know how to use it in that framework you used. Basically, learning a JavaScript framework doesn’t teach you JavaScript, rather it helps you learn a portion of it, not the entire language.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Limited modification
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Since frameworks are used to abstract higher functionality for software, there is only so much customization that a developer can do. If a developer wants functionality that is different than what the framework offers, then the developer should probably not use a framework but instead build it themselves.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Updates can introduce issues
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Frameworks constantly change their functionality and syntax over time. To keep software built with the framework supported, it will need to be modified so that it is compliant with the new and current version of the framework. This process is different for every framework, but generally a well-established framework will not change much of its core syntax.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blog-h4">
            Developers must understand the framework to work on software
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-p">
            For a developer to start working on an existing project with a team, that developer needs to have an understanding of the framework they are using. This often isn’t a huge issue, as developers can learn the framework, but can become a major disadvantage. For example, if the project was written in vanilla JavaScript, then it would be easier for any developer to jump in and start working on it compared to if the project was written in React which is more complex to learn.
        </p>

            How do frameworks help developers?
        </h2>
        <img class="center-images" src="assets/blog/developers.png"/>
        <p class="blog-p">
            The majority of startups and businesses built with a digital presence, use some sort of framework within their technical stack. This is mainly because of the advantages that each framework possess, but also because frameworks allow businesses and cheap and fast pathway to make software. Frameworks allow companies to rapidly prototype their product for all types platforms. They can build a product from a single codebase, that can run as a web application and mobile application that is supported on both iOS and Android. 
        </p>


        <!-- Conclusion -->

        <p class="blog-p">
            At the end of the day, frameworks allow developers to create software faster and better than they did before. With frameworks for
