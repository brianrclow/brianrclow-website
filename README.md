# brianrclow-website

brianrclow-website is my personal website where I keep up to date information about myself, my projects and links to other areas of interest.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about the process of web development and hosting. I also wanted a place where I could link to my other social accounts and be a hub for me as a person and as a developer.

## For the future...

I would like to keep adding to this website over this Fall 2020 semester as I complete my degree. I want to learn more about web development and understand more about how the industry works.
